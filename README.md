## Deployment

The system is deploid on a Heroku live server at `https://guarded-tundra-65894.herokuapp.com/`

## Built With

- [NodeJS](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - JavaScript runtime for backend
- [Express](https://maven.apache.org/) - Node.js web application framework
- [React](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) - JavaScript library used for the client
- [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/) - React UI Framework

## Considerations

- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is authentification method/protocol that I would use in order to add authentification to the service as it is a scalable technology that provides APIs, SDKs, live analytics and easy integration with social networks or passwordless services
- The service can become redundant at editing the data, as the editing needs to be done to the whole company and it's beneficial owners. That can be seen in the client-side too as I have different components displaying data for a single company and more of them. Although single responsability should be mentained, when designing an API the redundancy factor should alwas be kept in mind.

## Versioning

Heroku automatic versioning was used when deployed.
